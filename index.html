			  <li>Paul's Tutorials is moving to the HOT Team website!
		  <ul>
			  <li>Please note that, during this transition, pages may not be available. We're working on it.</li>
		  </ul>
		  </li>
			  <li>We're working on a number of improvements to the tutorials. They're not finished yet, but will be ready come build season.
		  <ul>
			  <li>The C++ Guided Tutorial is getting companion videos for each lesson. Currently, lessons 1-1 through 3-1 have videos. We're working on the rest.</li>
			  <li>The WPI Tutorial is receiving updated interactive activities. For timing reasons, we are working on getting the content moved. The activities will be added later.</li>

		  <h2 class="tutorial">About</h2>
		  <p>Paul's Tutorials is a series of in-depth tutorials designed to teach beginning programmers everything they need to know in order to program a robot. It includes a guided tutorial
		  through the <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial" target="_blank">C++ tutorial at cplusplus.com</a> and a thorough tutorial through WPILib.</p>
		  <p>If you have any suggestions or other feedback regarding the tutorials, please email <a href="mailto:heroesoftomorrowhot67@gmail.com">heroesoftomorrowhot67@gmail.com</a>.</p>
		  <h3 class="tutorial">Note to other teams</h3>
		  If you're from another team, cool! I hope you find this tutorial useful. However, I would like to point out that some of the activities are optimized for the resources we have
		  available for training new team members (largely robots from previous years). I encourage you to adjust these activities to fit the needs of your team. Please talk to a mentor or
		  an experienced team member about what you should do.

		  Also note that this tutorial teaches to program directly into the <code>BuiltinDefaultCode</code> template provided by WPI. While there are a few notes for the style provided by
		  RobotBuilder, programming using that method is not explored in this tutorial.
		  <p style="font-size: 0.75em; font-style: italic;">The WPILib tutorial is written and maintained by a student and as such is neither endorsed nor written by WPI.</p>
