  	<p>Paul's Tutorials is a series of in-depth tutorials designed to teach beginning programmers everything they need to know to program an FRC robot.
		It includes a guided tutorial through the <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial" target="_blank">C++ tutorial at cplusplus.com</a> and a tutorial over WPILib.</p>
	<p>Paul's Tutorials is written and maintained by students of FRC Team #67, The Heroes of Tomorrow. It is not endorsed by WPI.</p>
	
	<h2 class="tutorial">News</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Paul's Tutorials is going through a large upgrade and review process in preparation for next year.</li>
			<li>There are still some missing features, such as interactive activities and a few videos, but they are slowly being added.</li>
		</ul>
	
	<h2 class="tutorial">Note to other teams</h2>
		<p>If you're from another team, cool! I hope that you find these tutorials useful. We have put a lot of work into these so that they can be as accurate and informative as possible.</p>
		<p>We would like to point out, however, that specifically the WPI tutorial teaches students to program directly into the <code>IterativeRobot</code> class provided by WPI.
			There are style notes regarding the RobotBuilder tool on a few pages, but, for the most part, specifics on RobotBuilder are not explored as a part of this tutorial.</p>
		<p>Additionally, we have tried to make the WPI tutorial as resource-independent as possible, but there are some activities that include information on some of our past robots.
			If you see information like this, don't panic! Read the opening paragraphs of the activity's description closely; these describe the goal of the activity, so you can suit it to your needs.</p>
