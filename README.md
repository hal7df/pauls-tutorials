# pauls-tutorials
Source for Paul's Tutorials.

The current implementation is at [the HOT Team website](http://www.hotteam67.org/programming/pauls-tutorials), but this implementation is not as complete as what is in this repository. Once we get the pages working to our liking, we will post a new, complete implementation of the tutorials.

Paul's Tutorials are the programming tutorials for FRC Team #67, the 'HOT' Team. They teach new programmers C++ and WPILib with C++.

These pages are mostly complete, with C++ missing a few videos and WPI missing a few updated activities.
