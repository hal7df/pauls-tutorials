  	<p>When working on a coding project in a large group, it is imperative that everyone in the group has access to the latest version of the codebase.
  		Additionally, it is also important that the group have a backup of their code in case things go haywire.</p>
  	<p>This has been an issue of continuing importance basically as long as large group programming projects have existed.
  		As a result, tools known as <span style="font-style: italic;">version control systems</span>, or VCS for short, were developed.
  		These tools are designed to watch folders (specifically ones containing code projects) and keep track of the changes that are made to the files within.
  		Once a group member has made changes that they are satisfied with, they then upload these changes to a web server.
  		At this point, the other group members can then use the same software to fetch the new code and download it into their own copy.</p>
  	<p>On a robotics team, you will be working with a number of your peers on a programming project: that is, your robot's codebase.
  		On the HOT Team, we use a versatile VCS called <span style="font-style: italic;">git</span> to keep track of changes to our projects and to ensure everyone is using the same code.</p>
    <p>This short(er) tutorial will teach you the features that git has to offer, how it works, and how to use it.</p>
    <p>In addition to this tutorial, there are few good references and resources covering git that you should consult as well:</p>
