		<h2 class="tutorial"><a name="Function_Presentation"></a>Function Presentation</h2>
			<p>Now that we are diving into specific functions, it is important that you understand how they are presented to you in this tutorial. Whenever you are first given a function, its format will be like this:</p>
			<pre lang="cpp">
RETURN_TYPE ComponentClass::FunctionName(OPTION_TYPE options)
			</pre>
			<p>where: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>RETURN_TYPE</code> is the type of variable the function returns.</li>
				<li><code>ComponentClass</code> is the class the function originates from.</li>
				<li><code>FunctionName</code> is the actual name of the function.</li>
				<li><code>options</code> are the specific options that each function takes.</li>
				<ul>
					<li><code>OPTION_TYPE</code> is the type of that option.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p>What you see printed is NOT exactly what you type in. It is shown in this format for informative purposes.</p>
		<h2 class="tutorial"><a name="The_Game_Controller"></a>The Game Controller</h2>
			<p>There are really two different kinds of devices available for controlling the robot -- a game controller and a joystick. They have different programming interfaces. However, since we use the game controller, this tutorial will cover how to program for the game controller.</p>
			<h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Functions"></a>Functions</h3>
				<p>If you recall from <a href="../ch1/parts-code.html">the last lesson</a>, the game controller uses the <code>Joystick</code> class (the joystick does use this class, but it is programmed in a different way), and you need to provide the joystick ID in the constructor. For the purposes of this tutorial, let&#x27;s say that you declared a pointer to a <code>Joystick</code> called <code>m_gamepad</code> at ID 0.</p>
				<h4 class="tutorial"><a name="Buttons"></a>Buttons</h4>
					<p>Buttons are the simplest to program. They use the following function:</p>
					<pre lang="cpp">
bool Joystick::GetRawButton(int button_index)
					</pre>
					<p>where <code>button_index</code> is the numerical index of the desired button. For the XBox controller, this is the mapping:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A = 0</li>
						<li>B = 1</li>
						<li>X = 2</li>
						<li>Y = 3</li>
						<li>Left Bumper = 4</li>
						<li>Right Bumper = 5</li>
						<li>Back = 6</li>
						<li>Start = 7</li>
						<li>Left Stick = 8</li>
						<li>Right Stick = 9</li>
					</ul>
					<p style="font-style: italic;">TIP! Check out <a href="http://www.hotteam67.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Defines.h" target="_blank">Defines.h</a>!</p>
					<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING</span>: The left and right stick buttons are pressed when the actual joystick on the controller is pressed down. Because they are tied in with the controller, a driver can hit either button inadvertantly. Use these with extreme caution, if at all.</p>
					<p>This function returns true if the requested button is currently being held down.</p>
					<p>Note that the triggers are not here. They are treated as controller joysticks (you will see why in a moment).</p>
				<h4 class="tutorial"><a name="Controller_Joysticks"></a>Controller Joysticks</h4>
					<p>The joysticks on the game controller are accessed differently than you might think at first. Each joystick device is accessed in terms of its axes, and not the joystick as a whole (doing that would cause too many headaches).</p>
					<p>To access the value on any axis, use the following function:</p>
					<pre lang="cpp">
float Joystick::GetRawAxis(int axis_index)
					</pre>
					<p>where <code>axis_index</code> is the numerical index of the desired axis. This is the mapping:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Left stick, X axis = 0</li>
						<li>Left stick, Y axis = 1</li>
						<li>Triggers = 2</li>
						<li>Right stick, X axis = 3</li>
						<li>Right stick, Y axis = 4</li>
					</ul>
					<p style="font-style: italic;">These mappings are available as header definitions in <a href="http://www.hotteam67.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Defines.h" target="_blank">Defines.h</a> as well.</p>
					<h5 class="tutorial"><a name="The_Joysticks"></a>The Joysticks</h5>
						<p>The joysticks, or axes 0, 1, 3, and 4, act a bit differently than you might expect. Let&#x27;s look at axis 1, for example.</p>
						<p>If you were to push the left joystick forward, using <code>GetRawAxis()</code> on axis 1 actually returns a negative value. Similarly, if you pulled it back, <code>GetRawAxis</code> returns a positive value.</p>
						<p>Just like the vertical axes, the horizontal axes are also backwards. Using the <code>GetRawAxis()</code> on axis 0 would return a negative value if the joystick is pushed right, and a positive value if it is pushed left.</p>
						<p>Another thing of note is that, when the joystick is pushed to its maximum extent, the <code>GetRawAxis()</code> function's return value for that axis will have an absolute value of 1. So, if you pushed axis 2 to its furthest extent forward, it would return a value of -1.</p>
					<h5 class="tutorial"><a name="The_Triggers"></a>The Triggers</h5>
						<p>You may have noticed that the triggers of the game controller appear as axis 2. This is due to their capability of being able to tell exactly how far they are pressed down.</p>
						<p>They are on one axis because one axis is capable of representing both triggers -- the left trigger is positive, and the right trigger is negative.</p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING</span>: Because both triggers share one axis, holding both simultaneously will cause the values to cancel and return a value of 0.</p>
						<p>Generally, if you need to treat the triggers like a button, check if the axis is past a threshold of 0.4 (0.4 on the left, -0.4 on the right). However, if necessary, you can adjust this threshold to where the driver/operator is most comfortable.</p>
						<p>Again, the triggers will return an absolute value of 1 if one trigger is pressed completely.</p>
				<h2 class="tutorial"><a name="SmartDashboard"></a>SmartDashboard</h2>
					<p>One of the most important parts of programming in general is being able to do something that has a tangible result, even if it is a string of characters on a screen. To this point, you do not know how to make any visible result when you are programming the robot. For any programmer this is a problem.</p>
					<p>In the past, teams used to be able to write messages on the driver station panel. However, this is no longer the case. Now, teams must output robot data to one of many dashboards. In this lesson, you will learn how to output to WPI's SmartDashboard.</p>
					<h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Writing_to_SmartDashboard"></a>Writing to SmartDashboard</h3>
						<p>Unlike all of the other components on the robot, you do not declare a SmartDashboard object in your code. Instead, you access each write function directly, using the scope operator (<code>::</code>)</p>
						<p>Outputting data to SmartDasbhoard is different than outputting data to the terminal, like you're used to. When you write to SmartDashboard, you need to provide two things:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>(<code>key</code>) An identifier for the variable</li>
							<li>(<code>value</code>) A numerical or string variable</li>
						</ul>
						<p>All of the writing functions for <code>SmartDashboard</code> take two parameters (listed above). Which function you use depends on the data type you're using.</p>
						<p>Unlike all of the functions already discussed (and those that still have yet to be discussed), <code>SmartDashboard</code> functions are called exactly as they are presented in this tutorial (with the scope operator), like so:</p>
						<p>As soon as you call these functions, the data is immediately written to SmartDashboard on the driver station, no manual updating required.</p>
						<pre lang="cpp">
SmartDashboard::PutString("My robot is","awesome");
						</pre>
						<h4 class="tutorial"><a name="Numbers_PutNumber"></a>Numbers: <code>PutNumber()</code></h4>
							<p>For all number-based data, use the <code>PutNumber()</code> function. It takes a <code>double</code> value, but any numerical data type you use can be typecast to a <code>double</code>.</p>
							<pre lang="cpp">
void SmartDashboard::PutNumber(std::string key, double value)
							</pre>
						<h4 class="tutorial"><a name="Booleans_PutBoolean"></a>Booleans: <code>PutBoolean()</code></h4>
							<p>For true/false data, use the <code>PutBoolean()</code> function.</p>
							<pre lang="cpp">
void SmartDashboard::PutBoolean(std::string key, bool value)
							</pre>
						<h4 class="tutorial"><a name="Strings_PutString"></a>Strings: <code>PutString()</code></h4>
							<p>For strings, use the <code>PutString()</code> function. Because <code>std::string</code> derives from an array of <code>char</code>s (a C string), you can either pass a <code><q>string literal</q></code> or a C string as the <code>value</code> parameter.</p>
							<pre lang="cpp">
void SmartDashboard::PutString(std::string key, std::string value)
							</pre>
						<h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Reading_from_SmartDashboard"></a>Reading from SmartDashboard</h3>
							<p>One of the unique things about SmartDashboard is that the person at the driver station can change the value directly in SmartDashboard using only the keyboard. However, you need to be able to fetch that new value in order to be able to do anything with it.</p>
							<p>In order to do this, only one parameter is required:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><code>key</code>: The unique key for the value.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The <code>key</code> should match to whatever you set that value to be initially in the code with the <code>Put</code> functions.</p>
							<p>Like the <code>Put</code> functions, you call these using the scope operator, not by instantiating a <code>SmartDashboard</code> object. </p>
							<h4 class="tutorial"><a name="Numbers_GetNumber"></a>Numbers: <code>GetNumber()</code></h4>
								<pre lang="cpp">
double SmartDashboard::GetNumber(std::string key)
								</pre>
							<h4 class="tutorial"><a name="Booleans_GetBoolean"></a>Booleans: <code>GetBoolean()</code></h4>
								<pre lang="cpp">
bool SmartDashboard::GetBoolean(std::string key)
								</pre>
							<h4 class="tutorial"><a name="Strings_GetString"></a>Strings: <code>GetString()</code></h4>
								<pre lang="cpp">
std::string SmartDashboard::GetString(std::string key)
								</pre>
				<h2 class="tutorial"><a name="Implementing"></a>Implementing</h2>
					<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">This section just clarifies use of the functions we just discussed. If you feel confident, then you may <a href="#Programming_the_Robot">skip this section</a>.</p>
					<p>If you&#x27;re still a little confused, this section will help you understand the content better (hopefully).</p>
					<h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Quick_Note:_Periodic_Routines"></a>Quick Note: Periodic Routines</h3>
						<p>If you remember from <a href="../ch1/program-structure.html#Periodic_Routines">lesson 1-2</a>, <code>TeleopPeriodic()</code> will loop until the robot shuts down or another mode is entered. So, you must remember that, for the cases of this program, what you write is constantly running in a loop.
							Because it is already looping, you should write the <code>TeleopPeriodic()</code> function as if the whole thing were a loop. So, if you write something to the SmartDashboard in <code>TeleopPeriodic()</code>, it will write to SmartDashboard every time the CPU performs another loop.
							<span style="font-style: italic;">Future note: that is actually good, because then you can write real-time values to SmartDashboard.</span></p>
					<h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Button"></a>Button</h3>
						<p>For example, let&#x27;s look at a program that prints <q>Hello World!</q> to the driver station when, and only when, the A button is pressed.</p>
						<p>What we need:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A <code>Joystick</code> object</li>
						</ul>
						<pre lang="cpp">
#include "WPILib.h"

class Robot: public IterativeRobot
{
public:
	Joystick* m_gamepad;
  
	Robot()
	{
		m_gamepad = new Joystick(1);
	}
  
	//...
}
						</pre>
						<p>Now, we&#x27;re ready to start programming the logic. This program will only use the <code>TeleopPeriodic()</code> routine, so leave the other routines blank.</p>
						<pre lang="cpp">
//...
  
	void TeleopPeriodic()
	{
		/** The first thing we need to do
		  * is check for a button press.
		  * Because GetRawButton() returns
		  * a bool, we can simply put it
		  * in the if statement.
		  *
		  * Remember, button A is index
		  * 1.
		  */
      
		if (m_gamepad->GetRawButton(1))
		{
			/** The user has pressed the
			  * button. Set "Hello World" on the
			  * dashboard to true.
			  */
	  
			SmartDashboard::PutBoolean("Hello World",true);
		}
		else
		{
			/** The user has not pressed
			  * the button. Set the "Hellow World"
			  * on the dashboard to false.
			  */
	  
			SmartDashboard::PutBoolean("Hello World",false);
		}
	}

//...
  						</pre>
  					<h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Joystick"></a>Joystick</h3>
  						<p>Now, we will write a program that prints a message to the driver station and tells if either trigger is pressed past a threshold of 0.4.</p>
  						<p>What we need:</p>
  						<ul>
  							<li>A <code>Joystick</code> object</li>
  						</ul>
  						<pre lang="cpp">
#include "WPILib.h"
#include <cmath>
/** Because we want to know if
  * *either* trigger is pressed,
  * we need the axis' absolute
  * value. That function is in
  * cmath.
  */

class Robot: public IterativeRobot
{
public:
	Joystick* m_gamepad;
  
	Robot()
	{
		m_gamepad = new Joystick(1);
	}
  
	//...
}
						</pre>
						<p>Now, let's run through the program's logic.</p>
						<pre lang="cpp">
//...

	void TeleopPeriodic ()
	{
		//Easy things first...print the value of the axis to the driver station
		SmartDashboard::PutNumber("Left X Axis",m_gamepad->GetRawAxis(0);
    
    
		//Check to see if a trigger is being pressed beyond the threshold
		if (fabs(m_gamepad->GetRawAxis(2)) > 0.4)
			SmartDashboard::PutBoolean("Trigger Pressed",true);
		else
			SmartDashboard::PutBoolean("Trigger Pressed",false);  
	}
  
//...

				<h2 class="tutorial"><a name="Programming_the_Robot"></a>Programming the Robot</h2>
					<p>Congratulations! You are now capable of making (the electronics on) the robot do something! Activities beyond this point will involve creating real robot programs. Again, one of the parts of programming is actually running the code to test its functionality.</p>
					<p>This means actually downloading the code to the robot.</p>
					<p>You may do so, provided that:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>You have your mentor's approval</li>
						<li>(You have likely already discussed this) You shout <q>ENABLING</q> before you enable the robot -- loud enough for everyone to hear, but not too loud so that it is the last thing they hear. You should ALWAYS do this, regardless of the fact that your program might not do anything to actuate motors, but there is always a chance that something could go badly, so you need to take every precaution.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>As for actually downloading the code, this is how you do it:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Build the project - Ctrl+B</li>
						<ul>
							<li>As the programs you write grow more complex, you may need to clean as well (Project &gt; Clean)</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Check the downloader preferences if you haven&#x27;t already (you don&#x27;t need to do this every time, only when you switch projects).</li>
						<li>Make sure you are connected to the robot -- either by tether or wifi.</li>
						<li>Download the code (Run &gt; WPILib C++ Deployment)</li>
						<ul>
							<li>ENSURE A SECURE CONNECTION THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRETY OF THIS STEP!!!!</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Once the robot code is back up, you may enable.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Make sure that you are always downloading the right project when you download to the robot.</p>
				<h2 class="tutorial"><a name="Activity"></a>Activity</h2>
					<p>Write a program that does the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Has a counter (use a <code>float</code> for this)</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Counts <span style="font-weight: bold;">UP</span> on press of the A button</li>
							<li>Counts <span style="font-weight: bold;">DOWN</span> on press of the B button</li>
							<li>Note: you will need to use a <a href="../tips-tricks#Timers">timeout</a>.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Controls a <code>float</code> with the left joystick and triggers as follows:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>When the left joystick is pressed <span style="font-weight: bold;">FORWARD</span>, it counts <span style="font-weight: bold;">UP</span> at a speed determined by how far the stick is pressed forward.</li>
							<li>When the left joystick is pulled <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKWARD</span>, it counts <span style="font-weight: bold;">DOWN</span> at a speed determined by how far the stick is pulled back.</li>
							<li>When the left trigger is pressed in, the float becomes negative</li>
							<li>When the right trigger is pressed in, the float becomes positive</li>
							<li>Note: many of the controllers do not zero perfectly. Use a deadband of 0.2.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Print these numbers to SmartDashboard.</li>
					</ul>
